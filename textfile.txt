Summary of Work: Shiptivitas Kanban Feature

Feature: Implemented a 3-column Kanban board (Backlog, In Progress, Complete).

Technical Implementation: Used Dragula for drag-and-drop functionality and React Refs to link swimlane containers.

Acceptance Criteria Met:

All tasks correctly default to the "Backlog" swimlane.

Swimlanes utilize the required Swimlane-column CSS class.

Dynamic styling updates card colors based on the destination lane (Grey, Blue, or Green).

Environment Setup: Resolved a Node.js v22 OpenSSL compatibility error (ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED) by utilizing the --openssl-legacy-provider flag to ensure the development server remained stable.
